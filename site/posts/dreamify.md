## Introduction

In 2022, [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) was released. It is a deep learning, text-to-image model. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions.

But how to generate images with this model easily?

Introducing **Dreamify**.

### What is Dreamify?

**Dreamify** is the web application that allows you to generate images with AI without sign up and for free. It uses the [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) model to generate images. The model is run on cloud with [Replicate](https://replicate.com/).

### Software Information

- **Project technology**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Replicate
- **Industry**: AI tool
- **Work Duration**: â‰ˆ1 month
- **Accessibility WCAG**: AA (2.0)
- **Version**: 1.0

## Features

- Quick generation of images
- Access to advanced prompt settings
- Usage without sign up

## Development Process

Dreamify is a Next.js 13 app, with the UI built with Tailwind CSS. And with the API that interacts with Replicate.

### Creating the app

The app is created with Next.js 13. The new version brings radical changes to the way we work with React components and APIs.

### Creating the UI

The UI is built with Tailwind CSS. Components like the Buttons, Inputs, Modals and Progress Bar are developed with [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), a collection of re-usable components built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

### Building the API

The API is built with Next.js API Routes. It uses the Replicate API to run the model.

It uses two API routes:

- `/api/create` - Generates an image with the given prompt
- `/api/image/:id` - Returns the image generated by the `/api/generate` route by the given ID

### Choosing a cloud provider

The Machine Learning model is run on cloud with [Replicate](https://replicate.com/). Replicate is a platform for running and sharing machine learning models. Dreamify uses the Replicate API to run the model.

I choose Replicate because it's easy to use and it allows developers to check how the model is running per request.

## Future Improvements

- Create an Android/iPhone app
- Saving images in browser
